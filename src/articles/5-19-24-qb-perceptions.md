I have always been a strong believer in taking the late quarterback in fantasy football drafts and grabbing elite producers at other positions with early round picks. In fact, outside of Superflex dynasty drafts, the highest I’ve ever taken a QB in redraft leagues occurred last year where I took Trevor Lawrence in the 5th round, believing for the first time that the position had real scarcity. It didn’t work out for Lawrence last season, but as I look at this year’s ADP starting to take shape, the question once again begs to be answered - when is the right time to take a quarterback? 

Last year in 2023, I believe, was a unique case of QBs being pushed way up draft boards in a response to the season prior. We were a season removed from having 3 difference-making QBs and a whole lot of inconsistency and frustration everywhere else. Jalen Hurts, Josh Allen, and Patrick Mahomes were found on a ton of championship rosters in 2022, and the streaming options were mediocre at best from week to week. I remember seeing mock drafts the following year in 2023 where the top 3 QBs were going in the early to middle 2nd round, or even 1st round. And, this was all in single QB leagues.

However, there were basically 2.5 elite QBs in 2023 you felt very good about drafting where you did - Allen, Hurts, and Dak. I say 0.5 because Dak really only came on after the Cowboys BYE in week week 7. And, Dak wasn’t even the 3rd QB taken in ADP, he was the 10th. Mahomes finished the season with a lower points per game (PPG) average (18.4) than Kyler Murray (18.9) and was way below Joe Flacco (21.8!) during his stretch. The entire position just felt lackluster last year. Baker Mayfield averaged the same PPG as Tua (16.7) and more than Joe Burrow (15.3), and that was a full point worse per game than Russell Wilson (17.7). 

I say all of this because as I look at the landscape of the position and early mock drafts this year, I’m seeing a lot of QBs that I would feel very comfortable with starting for my fantasy team. I can go all the way down to QB17 right now, which currently is Kirk Cousins according to FantasyPros, and feel great about them putting up consistent production. There’s even more QBs after Cousins like Jayden Daniels and Justin Fields that certainly could put up big numbers, just with more unknown and risk. 

Just look at Dak. He finished last year very comfortably as the QB3, yet he is QB9 right now in consensus ADP. That’s below guys like Jordan Love, CJ Stroud, and Anthony Richardson, all of whom did worse in total points and points per game last season. With the Cowboys adding nothing of note to their run game, I’d much rather run it back with Dak whose current ADP is 61st overall. Kyler is going even later, and they just added Marvin Harrison Jr. Or, Purdy who’s going 83rd overall right now and was only 1.5 PPG worse than Dak last year, finishing QB6.

Is it possible that Allen, Hurts, Mahomes, etc. are just **that** much better than everyone else this season? Absolutely. But, with at least two of them, you’re counting on outlier rushing TD production, and you have to pay a premium to get them on your team. This means you are passing on other elite wide receivers and running backs. 

In 2021, there were 10 QBs that averaged over 20 fantasy PPG. That number dropped to 4 in 2022 and 2023. I don’t expect this trend to continue into this season, and my hunch is that QB scoring will rebound. You could even look at the new kickoff rules and argue that there will be more scoring opportunities overall than in years past.

All this being said, you can’t ignore the legend that is Josh Allen and what he’s done for fantasy teams. Since 2020, he’s averaged over 24 PPG in every single season. You could argue that he’ll be worse without Diggs, but he basically lost Diggs last season even with him on the field. I can’t fault a fantasy player for wanting Allen and willing to pay the iron price for him. But, for those other QBs going in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th rounds, I’ll be passing.

### QB VALUE EXPERIMENT

I compiled some hypothetical pairings of 1 QB + 1 WR, RB, or TE based off of 2023 ADP to see if it really pays off to wait on QB. I will find the Average Draft Position (ADP) of a few QBs that went in either the 2nd or 3rd round, and then I will find the late round correlating players based off of ADP to pair him with. I will then also look at late round QBs that went in the 9th and 10th rounds and pair them with the equivalent 2nd or 3rd round player. The round-to-round correlation will be 2nd & 9th and 3rd & 10th - that way, the distance between the two players is the same across all pairings. For example, if a team has the 3rd pick and takes a QB in round 2 (2.10), I will pair that QB with whatever player is at 9.03, strictly according to ADP.

I’ll then calculate the total points between the two players and examine the results. I have a few caveats for this exercise: I will be using FantasyPros PPR 2023 ADP, and I won’t include players with significant injuries. If the correlating player got a significant injury, I’ll move UP ADP to the next player to give the benefit of the doubt to the teams and not skew the data negatively (luckily, this only happened once with the Mahomes pairing).

Here are the pairings:

Pairing 1 (4th pick)  
Josh Allen - 2.09 (21st overall) - 410.6  
Jakobi Meyers - 9.04 (100th overall) - 147.6  
**Total: 558.2**  

Pairing 2 - (12th pick)  
Lamar Jackson - 3.12 (36th overall) - 338.2  
Treylon Burks - 10.01 (109th overall) - 23.9  
**Total: 362.1**  

Pairing 3 (11th pick)  
Patrick Mahomes - 2.02 (14th overall) - 294.1  
Mike Williams - 9.11 (107th overall) - HURT - 31.2  
Pat Freiermuth - 9.10 (106th overall) - HURT - 44.8  
JSN - 9.07 (103rd overall) - 86.8 (2 DSTs picked between 106th and 103rd)  
Total (with Williams): 325.3  
Total (with Freiermuth): 338.9  
**Total (with JSN): 380.9**  

Pairing 4 - (9th pick)  
Brock Purdy - 10.09 (117th overall) - 306.6  
Keenan Allen - 3.04 (28th overall): 170.9  
**Total: 477.5**  

Pairing 5 (7th pick)  
Jared Goff - 10.06 (114th overall) - 303.1  
Joe Mixon - 3.07 (31st overall) - 215  
**Total: 518.1**  

### Processing the Data

I know this study isn’t perfect, but I wanted to try to encapsulate the type of players that you pass on when you take a QB early and really see if it was worth it. The pairing with the most points actually did draft an early QB in Josh Allen, scoring 40 more points than the next closest pairing in the Goff/Mixon stack. However, the Mahomes and Jackson pairings fell far behind the late QB teams. 

Mahomes' corresponding 9th round pick would have been Mike Williams, but he basically missed the whole season. So, I moved up ADP to Freiermuth who also missed significant time. Then, there was the Jets and Bills D/ST, respectively, so I skipped them. That brought me to JSN, which I believe would be the most accurate player to pair with Mahomes for fairness. I left the totals with Mahomes + Williams & Freiermuth just in case some of you were curious.

The Purdy/Keenan Allen stack is probably the most interesting to me out of this. Keenan missed 4 games in the fantasy season, but I didn’t count him out as ‘injured’ since he still put up big numbers for the games he was healthy. Had he played a full season, I could easily see this pairing getting close to or beating the Josh Allen stack.

I know what you’re asking: But, Chris, what about teams that took a late QB that was bad?? Well, unfortunately, there were only 3 quarterbacks taken in rounds 9 & 10, and one of them was Deshaun Watson who missed the vast majority of the season with injury. However, I do have a bonus pairing for you with Geno Smith, who was drafted just one pick after round 10. But, let’s just pretend he was in round 10, and we’ll use his 3rd round equivalent.

Bonus Pairing 6 (1st pick)  
Geno Smith - 11.01 (121st overall) - 235.3  
Mark Andrews - 3.01 (25th overall) - HURT - 90.4  
Chris Olave - 2.12 (24th overall) - 144.3  
Total (with Andrews): 325.7  
**Total (with Olave): 379.6**  

Andrews missed 5 games of the fantasy season, so if you want to move to the next player, the Geno/Olave stack basically put up the same number of points as the Mahomes and Jackson pairings shown above. And, if you wanted to split hairs, you could argue that Geno also missed 2 games during the fantasy season. A full season very likely would have pushed their total over 400.

I think the results are very interesting! At least, I hope they are. I might do tight ends next, or some rookie talk.
