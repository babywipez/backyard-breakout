The first thing someone suggested to me after reading my first article was to run a similar experiment with tight ends that I did with quarterbacks. This is a great idea because the TE position is very similar to QB in many ways. In a typical redraft league, teams are only playing one tight end, so having an elite option where yours is putting up 5-10 more points per game than the league average TE is a huge boost to your fantasy output.

Historically, however, the position has been one the most frustrating. Even when comparing tight ends to something like D/ST, the matchup often means nothing. Trends and historical data on how defenses play against tight ends can be helpful, but I’m sure everyone reading this article can think of several times where the matchup looked perfect for a streaming option, and you got a whopping 5 points from them.

Tight end is also a position where the format of the league makes a massive difference in how players perform and are valued. For example, in standard scoring, Evan Engram finished last year as TE6, but in PPR, Engram was TE2, only 6 total fantasy points behind LaPorta. For my purposes, I’ll be looking at PPR.

Before we construct the pairings, I wanted to look at playoff team roster percentages and see if having one of the top tight ends was a true difference maker for winning fantasy leagues. According to ESPN (https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/id/39104508/fantasy-football-playoffs-2023-most-common-players-rosters), the tight end with the largest playoff roster percentage was actually T.J. Hockenson at 60.5%, which ranked 8th. The next highest was LaPorta at 60.4% which ranked 10th. Then, there is a big gap until the next highest, Kittle at 53.0% - 20th.

This was mildly surprising to me, but it really shouldn’t be. Hockenson was tied for 1st in points per game (14.6) with Kelce, and there’s a very good chance he would have finished 1st in total points had he not gotten injured in week 16. If you take his 14.6 PPG pace and add the two games he missed, he would have finished with 248.2 total fantasy points, which would have made him TE1 over LaPorta.

What really surprised me looking at that playoff roster percentage breakdown is that Evan Engram is 45th on the list. The overall TE2 that averaged 13.5 fantasy PPG had a playoff roster percentage of 46.3%. Meanwhile, the QB2, Jalen Hurts, was 7th in that list, with a 61.3% playoff roster percentage. So, is having an elite TE really that beneficial?

Well, in 2022, the playoff roster percentage breakdown looked very different. (https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/id/35246717/jalen-hurts-travis-kelce-most-common-espn-fantasy-football-playoff-players). Sitting at #1 was Travis Kelce with a dominant 71.7%, just 1.1% behind last year’s CMC percentage. Mark Andrews was the next highest TE, ranked 22nd with a 52.8% playoff roster percentage. 2022 was an interesting year in that overall TE scoring was low, but Kelce was a dominator at the position and scored over 100 more total fantasy points (316.3) than the next highest (Hockenson - 215.4). Kelce averaged 18.6 FPPG, absolutely nuts.

My takeaway so far is that having one of the elite tight ends **is** very helpful for winning fantasy leagues, but it’s especially helpful when the mediocre range of tight ends performs more like trash than mediocre.

### Tight End Value Experiment

Okay, let’s get into constructing our pairings to examine if taking an early TE is worth it compared to waiting and grabbing one later in the draft. I’ll be using the same parameters for this analysis as I did with the quarterbacks. I’ll be using FantasyPros 2023 ADP & I won’t include players that missed significant time with injury. If the ADP suggests an injured player, I will move up ADP until I find a non-injured one.

The only difference will be the round-to-round correlation. Because tight ends were drafted all over the place and didn’t really have little clumps to analyze, I’m going to use 4 sets of correlated rounds instead of 2, but they will still have the same distance between them (7 rounds). They will be 2nd & 9th, 3rd & 10th, 4th & 11th, and 6th & 13th. I realize that going as far down as the 6th round may not qualify as an ‘early’ tight end to some, but let’s just roll with it and keep that in the back of our minds.

### Processing the Data

Overall, I think this experiment is less useful than the one I ran for QBs. I do think there’s some interesting takeaways, however.

On average, the early tight end pairings scored less points than the late round pairings. One big outlier is the Pitts / Nacua stack. Puka was a revelation and had a season unlike any rookie we’ve ever seen, breaking the rookie record for receptions and receiving yards in 2023. There will always be late round gems and big time sleepers, but I would venture a guess that we won’t see a round 10 WR finish top 4 at the position again.

Hockenson’s 10th round partner was Tyler Bass, a kicker, so I moved to the next player in ADP, Burks. Those of you who read my QB article may remember that Burks showed up there and is basically a death sentence for this type of study. As a side note, Tyler Bass finished as K17 last season. If you take nothing else away from this article, please don’t reach on kickers, y’all.

Some of the data here is misleading in nature. For example, the Kmet / Mattison stack scored more total points together than the Hockenson / Burks stack. But, if you asked the fantasy community which one they would have preferred, I’m sure the vast majority would have wanted the Hockenson stack and just dropped Burks early on. Sure, Kmet had some big games, but the combination of he and Mattison really didn’t help fantasy teams due to their wild inconsistency.

Next, I wanted to look at the LaPorta / Devonta Smith pairing, which still somehow fell behind the Kincaid / St. Brown stack by about 15 total points, despite LaPorta finishing TE1. That is probably the most interesting nugget for me so far. The top end WRs produced so much more than the top end TEs last season. In PPR, the average fantasy points per game for the top 5 WRs in 2023 was 20.5 whereas the average PPG for the top 5 TEs was 13.9.

There are some other interesting tight ends that do not have a pairing in this experiment due to various circumstances. David Njoku had a pretty good season, finishing TE6, but his ADP was in the 8th round, just outside of our scope. Mark Andrews and Darren Waller also didn’t get pairings due to missing significant time with injuries. Andrews did average 13.5 PPG for the games he was healthy, which tied Engram. If you asked me over/under on his PPG next season, I would take the over.

### Tight Ends in 2024

The tight end landscape feels different this year than it has in years past. There’s a lot of young emerging talent that feels quite dependable - guys like Kincaid, LaPorta, McBride, and even Kyle Pitts with the change at QB. I was surprised to learn that Pitts is actually younger than both McBride and Kincaid, and he’s just a few months older than LaPorta. But, to get them on your roster, you’re going to have to burn a pick in the first 5 rounds.

Trey McBride is a fascinating player and one that I will be very tempted to gravitate towards in the late 3rd & early 4th rounds this season. From week 6 on, McBride averaged 13.8 PPG, and if you extrapolate that over 17 games, he would have finished the season with 234.6 total fantasy points. That would have made him TE2, just ~5 total fantasy points behind LaPorta.

There are also plenty of late round tight ends that I think are quite interesting this season. Evan Engram’s current ADP is 6.08, and I think his target share and role in the offense is secure in 2024. Njoku is going even later at 8.07, and his role has the opportunity to actually expand going into this season based on what he was able to do last season when given the opportunity. However, my gut tells me that my late round target will be Jake Ferguson whose current ADP is 8.01. Ferguson just seems like a safe option with a high floor and low ceiling, and I don’t mind those types of players in the TE spot specifically.

Okay, that’s it for this one! I have a short list of topics I want to cover for the next article, but I think it may be some rookie or dynasty talk.
